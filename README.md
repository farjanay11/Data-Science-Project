Customer Sentiment Analysis on Trustpilot Reviews using Topic Modeling and Sentiment Classification
Overview

Project Description
The aim of this project is to perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling on customer reviews collected from Trustpilot. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the project extracts meaningful insights about customer satisfaction and feedback trends.

Objectives
Collect and preprocess customer review data from Trustpilot.

Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling.

Use sentiment classification to assess positive, negative, or neutral feedback.

Visualize key trends and topics using various data visualization tools.
