## 📝 Project Overview

This project applies **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for topic modeling on Tesla customer reviews collected from **Trustpilot**. The objective is to extract latent themes such as customer sentiment, service quality, and feature satisfaction from unstructured textual data.

---

## 🧪 Mid-Term Project 
### 🔍 Objectives:
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a synthetic loan approval dataset.
- Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, normalization, and outlier handling.
- Apply statistical methods to understand central tendency and spread.

### 🛠 Tools & Techniques:
- R (readxl, dplyr)
- Measures: Mean, Median, Mode, IQR, Variance, Standard Deviation
- Preprocessing: Missing values, outliers, encoding categorical data

---

## ✅ Final-Term Project 

### 🔍 Objectives:
- Scrape Tesla customer reviews from Trustpilot using R.
- Preprocess text (stopwords removal, TF-IDF weighting).
- Apply LDA using `topicmodels` package in R.
- Visualize topics using `ggplot2` and evaluate coherence.

### 📊 Key Findings:
- Identified 15 coherent topics from reviews.
- Highlighted themes: delivery issues, autopilot performance, service delays, and customer experience.

### 🛠 Tools Used:
- R (rvest, tm, tidytext, topicmodels, ggplot2)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Open the `.Rmd` or `.R` scripts for preprocessing and modeling.
2. Ensure required R libraries are installed.
3. Run scripts in order:
   - Web scraping
   - Text preprocessing
   - Topic modeling using LDA
   - Visualization and evaluation

## 📌 Notes
- Academic project focused on Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Learning.
- Ethical handling of data and reproducibility of results were prioritized.
